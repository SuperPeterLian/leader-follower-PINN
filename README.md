# Physics-Informed Neural Network for Leader–Follower Cell Invasion Modeling

This repository contains a PINN-based parameter inference framework for a leader–follower partial differential equation (PDE) model of collective cancer cell migration.  
The model simultaneously fits spatiotemporal data and enforces governing PDE constraints, recovering 8 biophysical parameters.

## 🧠 Project Summary

This project uses a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to estimate diffusion, adhesion, and chemotaxis-related parameters in a biologically-inspired PDE system governing the interaction between leader and follower cells. The model is trained using both data fidelity loss and physics-based residual loss.
